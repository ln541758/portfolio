      "<p>Passengers rely on signage for wayfinding decisions in transportation buildings. Most research focuses on wayfinding trajectories, with less attention on how decisions are made, making it hard to pinpoint causes of errors. Using eye-tracking technology, this study recorded passenger eye movements at Shanghai Pudong Airport's Satellite Terminal, analyzing behavior like reconfirmation, attention priority, and clockwise observation. Data visualization revealed reasons for wrong decisions, leading to optimized signage design. Improved signage received positive feedback from passengers within two months, as shown by monthly questionnaires.</p>",
